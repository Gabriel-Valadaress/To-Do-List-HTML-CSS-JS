To-Do List (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
This is a simple To-Do List application I built to practice working with objects in JavaScript.

Features
Add new tasks with a description and creation date.
Mark tasks as completed, moving them to a separate list.
Delete tasks from both pending and completed lists.
All interactions occur on a single screen for a smooth user experience.
UI Design
The UI was generated using uxpilot.ai with the following prompt:

"The To-Do List app will have a single screen with the following elements: an input field to enter a new task and an 'Add Task' button to add it to the pending tasks list. Each task will display its description, creation date, and two buttons: 'Mark as Completed' to move the task to the completed list and 'Delete' to remove it. The completed tasks list will show each task with its description, completion date, and a 'Delete' button to remove it permanently. This way, all interactions happen on a single screen, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience."

About This Project
This is my first completed To-Do List project, and it helped me reinforce my understanding of JavaScript objects and DOM manipulation.
